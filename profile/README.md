## üåê Vision

**HushNet** is my attempt to rethink how private communication should work ‚Äî  without intermediaries, analytics, or dependency on corporate servers.  

I‚Äôm building a communication layer where anyone can talk, share, and sync securely, while keeping full control over their infrastructure.  

---

## üí° Principle

Traditional messaging apps rely on **centralized trust**:  
your messages go through someone else‚Äôs server ‚Äî even if they‚Äôre encrypted.  
That‚Äôs still a single point of failure, of censorship, and of visibility.

HushNet takes the opposite approach:  
- The app handles **end-to-end encryption** natively.  
- The backend is **open-source** and **self-hostable**.  
- Anyone can connect to their own instance ‚Äî or to a public node if they prefer.  

> No account lock-ins. No mandatory servers. No surveillance economy.  
> Just pure encrypted communication, wherever you choose to host it.

## üîê Encryption Model

HushNet uses a **modern E2EE architecture** inspired by the **Signal Double Ratchet** protocol.  
Each user‚Äôs device maintains its own key state and updates it after every message,  
ensuring *forward secrecy* and *post-compromise security*.

### üß≠ Flow Overview

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Alice (Client)
    participant SA as Alice's Server
    participant SB as Bob's Server
    participant B as Bob (Client)

    Note over A,B: Prekey generation & publication phase
    A->>SA: Publishes Identity Key + Signed PreKey + One-Time PreKeys
    B->>SB: Publishes Identity Key + Signed PreKey + One-Time PreKeys

    Note over A,B: Session setup
    A->>SB: Retrieves Bob‚Äôs prekeys
    A->>A: Derives shared secret (X3DH)
    A->>SA: Sends Encrypted Message (via Double Ratchet)
    SA-->>SB: Forwards Encrypted Message
    SB-->>B: Delivers Ciphertext

    Note over B: Session established
    B->>B: Decrypts with derived shared secret
    B->>A: Replies using updated Double Ratchet keys
```

## üß© How It Works

- The **HushNet App** (client) manages keys, sessions, and encrypted messages locally.  
- The **HushNet Server** (Rust backend) acts as a simple message relay ‚Äî it never sees plaintext.  
- Each user (or organization) can **run their own server**, register devices, and federate with others.  
- The app lets you **select or configure your own node** at any time.  

This means:
- You can use the default HushNet node ‚Äî or self-host your own in a few commands.  
- You can run it privately for your friends, company, or research network.  
- You can fork and extend the protocol freely.

## üß† Philosophy

HushNet is built on three principles:

1. **Silence** ‚Äî communication without noise, tracking, or exposure.  
2. **Resilience** ‚Äî networks that survive censorship and compromise.  
3. **Transparency** ‚Äî every component open to audit and improvement.

I don‚Äôt want users to depend on me ‚Äî I want them to **depend on math**.  
Encryption replaces trust. Openness replaces authority.

## üîê Core Ideas

- **End-to-End Encryption by Default**  
- **Forward Secrecy** via the Double Ratchet protocol  
- **Multi-device support** with identity-linked prekeys  
- **Federation-Ready Design** ‚Äî connect to your own node or others  
- **Zero Metadata Policy** ‚Äî no message content, no analytics, no profiles  

> Privacy doesn‚Äôt require permission.  
> It requires architecture.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è License

Everything under **HushNet** is open source and free to use, study, or modify.  
Code is released under permissive licenses (MIT or Apache-2.0).  
Security should thrive in the open ‚Äî not behind NDAs.
